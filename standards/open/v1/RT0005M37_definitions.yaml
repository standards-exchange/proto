CTF: Counter-terrorist financing (CTF) refers to the set of policies, procedures, and measures that aim to prevent terrorist groups from raising, moving, or using funds to support their activities. CTF is an important component of the broader efforts to combat terrorism, and it involves the cooperation of financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and governments around the world. 
  CTF measures typically include enhanced due diligence, customer screening, transaction monitoring, and the reporting of suspicious activities to regulatory authorities. Financial institutions are required to implement CTF programs under the anti-money laundering (AML) regulations in many countries. CTF measures are also often included in international sanctions and embargoes, which restrict the movement of funds to individuals or entities that have been identified as terrorist or terrorist-related.
  By preventing terrorist groups from accessing the funds they need to carry out their activities, CTF helps to disrupt their operations and reduce the risk of terrorist attacks. CTF is an ongoing effort that requires continuous monitoring and adaptation to changing threats and new technologies.
EDD: EDD stands for "Enhanced Due Diligence". It is a process that involves additional scrutiny and risk assessment of customers that are considered to be of higher risk, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs), high net worth individuals, and businesses in high-risk industries. EDD measures typically involve gathering additional information and documentation, performing more extensive background checks, and monitoring transactions more closely. The goal of EDD is to help financial institutions identify and mitigate the increased risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities associated with higher-risk customers. EDD is often required by law or regulatory bodies in many countries, particularly for institutions subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations.
CDD: CDD stands for "Customer Due Diligence". It is a process that involves collecting and verifying information about a customer's identity, business activities, and risk profile to assess their potential for involvement in money laundering or terrorist financing. CDD is a key element of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) programs, as it helps to ensure that financial institutions know their customers and are able to identify and prevent suspicious or illicit activities. CDD measures typically include collecting and verifying identifying information, assessing the customer's risk profile, and monitoring transactions for suspicious activity.
KYC: KYC stands for "Know Your Customer", and it is a set of procedures that financial institutions use to verify the identity of their customers and assess the risks associated with doing business with them. KYC is a key element of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) programs, as it helps to ensure that financial institutions know who their customers are and are able to identify and prevent suspicious or illicit activities.
  KYC procedures typically involve collecting and verifying identifying information, such as name, address, and date of birth, and assessing the customer's risk profile based on factors such as their business activities, source of funds, and geographic location. Financial institutions are required to perform KYC under AML and CTF regulations in many countries.
