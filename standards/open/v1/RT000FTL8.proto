This is done by adjusting the NAV of the fund to reflect the anticipated costs associated with buying or selling the underlying assets of the fund. The adjustment is typically made by charging or crediting a "swing factor" to the NAV of the fund, which is based on the size of the purchase or redemption relative to the fund's assets under management (AUM). The goal of swing pricing is to ensure that the costs of buying and selling assets are borne by those who cause the costs, rather than by all shareholders of the fund.
